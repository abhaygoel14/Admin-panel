# Highradius_internship

**HighRadius is a Fintech enterprise Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) company which leverages Artificial Intelligence-based Autonomous Systems to help companies automate Accounts Receivable and Treasury processes.**

In this internship the time frame has been divided into two phases where:
## Phase 1: (Project)
In the first phase we build a machine learning model that automates `account receivables` given a dataset/data(supervised machine learning). We have to understand the data, preporcess the data, execute feature engineering and finally train a model to predict `account receivables`.
But usually client make a delayed payment. We have to predict the delayed date at which the client will make the payment. 
I used several Machine Learning Algorithm to predict my target variable.
